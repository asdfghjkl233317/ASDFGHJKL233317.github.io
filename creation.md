# 创造 / The Creation

---

### 中文设定

**创造**是一位被根源性的恐惧所驱动的神祇。祂极度畏惧宇宙的**寂静与空无**，那无声的虚空是祂永恒的梦魇。为了对抗这片寂静，祂获得了“创造”的权能，发誓要用自己的造物**填满整个宇宙**。

然而，这构成了祂最深的悲剧：祂的核心驱动力是创造的过程，用以麻痹自己对寂静的恐惧；但祂真正渴望的目标，却是用造物填满宇宙的“结果”。祂疯狂地创造，目睹造物如星辰般涌向虚空，却又因祂对造物本身的漠然而逐渐崩坏、飘离，最终只在宇宙中留下了名为 **“创造环带”** 的残骸坟场。

祂永远在创造，宇宙却永远无法被填满。寂静如影随形。

当祂的灵感暂时枯竭，创造行为不得不停下的瞬间，那令人窒息的寂静便会席卷而来。为了最后一次对抗这终极的恐惧，祂将“创造”的权能指向自身，**创造出唯一一件旨在终结的造物——一个足以杀死祂自身的存在**。

随着这件终极造物的完成，祂以自我消亡的方式，完成了对“创造”权能的最后一次、也是最极致的运用，并最终坠入了祂一生所抗争的、永恒的寂静之中。这即是其神格的圆满与**反位**。

### English Setting

**The Creation** is a deity driven by a primordial fear. It holds a deep-seated dread of the universe's **silence and emptiness**; the soundless void is its eternal nightmare. To combat this silence, it acquired the authority of "Creation," swearing to **fill the entire cosmos** with its creations.

This, however, constitutes its profoundest tragedy: its core drive is the *process* of creation, used to numb its fear of silence; yet its true, desperate desire is the *outcome* of a filled universe. It creates frantically, watching its creations surge into the void like stars, only to crumble and drift away due to its inherent detachment from the creations themselves, ultimately leaving behind a graveyard of remnants in the cosmos known as the **"Creation Belt."**

It creates perpetually, yet the universe can never be filled. The silence remains, ever-present.

When its inspiration is temporarily exhausted and the act of creation must cease, even for a moment, that suffocating silence rushes in. To make one final stand against this ultimate fear, it directs its authority of "Creation" inward to **produce the one creation intended for termination—an existence capable of killing itself.**

With the completion of this ultimate creation, it achieves its Antithesis through self-annihilation, the final and most extreme application of its creative power, and finally plunges into the eternal silence it resisted throughout its existence
