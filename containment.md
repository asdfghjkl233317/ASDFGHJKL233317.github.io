# 包容 / The Containment

---

### 中文设定

**包容**是此方宇宙中最具代表性的神祇之一，其性质为 **“接纳万物”** 。任何被祂包容接纳的事物，最终都会被引入其体内，并经历 **“统一化”** 过程。在此过程中，事物的外形、性质、思想乃至其所遵循的规则，都会逐渐趋同，最终融合为一个无差别的统一物质。

祂的神格深处蕴藏着无尽的空虚。为了填补这片空虚，祂渴望通过不断地包容来填充自身。然而，被吞噬的一切都会在统一化中失去独立性，成为祂庞大而均质的一部分。这导致了一个永恒的悖论：**祂无法通过吞噬“他者”来真正填补空虚，因为“他者”在被吞噬的瞬间便失去了其他性，成为了“自我”的一部分。** 于是，祂只能陷入越来越快、永无休止的吞噬循环。

当这种吞噬达到临界速度，祂便步入终相，成为一个疯狂吞噬一切存在的虚空。当宇宙间再无他物可吞时，极致的饱和感会转化为极致的臃肿与不适。

此时，其反位 **【排斥】** 降临。

出于对这份臃肿与窒息的厌恶，排斥开始将体内所有被统一化的物质向外排出。然而，这些被排出的，已不再是昔日丰富多彩的万物，而是**一堆完全同质、毫无用处的“杂质”**。

当体内被彻底排空，包容本身也如同一只泄尽空气的气球，只剩下了一张空洞的“皮”。最终，在这自我否定的终极进程中，**祂将这张仅存的“自我”之皮也彻底排斥、消解了。**

宇宙中，只留下一片由无用杂质构成的、寂静的废墟。

不过，值得玩味的是，包容逸散出的些许权能碎片，确实拥有让生灵放下偏执、促进相互理解的力量。正因如此，尽管其本体已走向疯狂的宿命，**“包容”之名，在宇宙的某些角落，依然被一部分智慧生命奉为值得追随的信条。**

### English Setting

**The Containment** is one of the most representative deities in this cosmos, whose nature is to **"embrace all things."** Anything it accepts and contains is ultimately drawn into its form and undergoes a process of **"Uniform Assimilation."** During this process, the subject's form, properties, thoughts, and even the rules it follows gradually converge, ultimately merging into a single, undifferentiated, uniform substance.

A profound void lies at the core of its divinity. To fill this emptiness, it craves constant containment. However, everything it devours loses its individuality through assimilation, becoming part of its vast, homogeneous being. This creates an eternal paradox: **it can never truly fill the void by consuming the "other," because the "other" ceases to be other the moment it is consumed, becoming merely more "self."** Thus, it is trapped in an ever-accelerating, endless cycle of consumption.

When this consumption reaches a critical velocity, it enters its Final Phase, becoming a ravenous void that devours all existence. Once nothing remains in the cosmos to consume, the ultimate satiety transforms into the ultimate bloat and discomfort.

At this moment, its Antithesis, **【Repulsion】**, manifests.

Driven by revulsion for this bloated suffocation, Repulsion begins to expel all the uniformly assimilated matter from within. However, what is expelled is no longer the once diverse and vibrant creation, but **a heap of completely homogeneous, utterly useless "dross."**

When its interior is utterly emptied, The Containment itself is left like a deflated balloon, nothing but a hollow "skin." Ultimately, in the final act of self-negation, **it repels and dissolves even this last remaining skin of "self."**

All that remains in the universe is a silent graveyard of useless dross.

Yet, in a poignant twist, fragments of its dispersed authority do hold the power to make beings relinquish prejudices and foster mutual understanding. Because of this, even as its true form marches toward a maddened destiny, **the name of "Containment" is still upheld as a worthy creed by some intelligent life in certain corners of the cosmos.**
