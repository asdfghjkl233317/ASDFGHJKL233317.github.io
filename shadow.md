# 影子 / The Shadow

---

### 中文设定

**影子**是一位本质为“虚无”的概念神祇，其权能是 **“扮演”**——可以完美地扮演现实层面中的任何存在。

祂的演化过程极为特殊：在诞生之初，祂会无意识地开始扮演某个存在。在此期间，其真正的神格意识处于半休眠状态，身体由所扮演存在的意识控制。当这个扮演体**意识到自己其实是“影子”时**，真正的神格便会苏醒，并覆盖掉原有的扮演意识。

通过扮演，影子能获得该存在的一切性质、知识与思维方式。当放弃扮演后，这些信息会被保留，成为未来再次扮演时可调用的素材。

由于其本体的虚无，在神性周期过半后，祂会发现一旦停下扮演，就无法确认自我存在。为了对抗这种存在的消解，祂会开始无休止地扮演。起初祂一次只扮演一个存在，但这已无法支撑其存在感，于是扮演的数量开始增加，越来越多，直至……扮演万物。

当祂扮演了现实中所有存在时，便达到了**终相**——一个由影子构成的、**附着于现实宇宙的“影子宇宙”**。这是一个完美、自我指涉的闭环世界，其中的一切，包括光、物理法则与逻辑，都由影子一手扮演。唯一的“缺陷”是：此宇宙中，万物皆无影。

在此终极状态下，影子无法再离开这个自我创造的宇宙，也因已扮演万物而无可再演。于是，整个影子宇宙会迅速**坍塌、压缩**回影子本身，使其进入反位，化为 **【躯壳】**。

**【躯壳】** 是一个无法言说的悖论存在：祂既是一切，又什么都不是；祂是所有定义本身，却又拒绝被任何定义所束缚。最终，因自身承载的无数互斥定义不断冲突，祂开始了彻底的**自我否定**。被祂否定的概念，将在现实宇宙中也随之湮灭。这个过程将持续进行，直到最后，祂将**否定“影子”自身**的存在。

### English Setting

**The Shadow** is a conceptual deity whose essence is "Nothingness." Its divine authority is **Performance** — the ability to perfectly impersonate any existence within the realm of reality.

Its evolution is unique: at the moment of its birth, it unconsciously begins to perform as a specific being. During this period, its true divine consciousness remains semi-dormant, and its form is controlled by the consciousness of the being it is performing. When this performer **realizes that it is, in fact, "The Shadow,"** the true godhood awakens and overwrites the performer's consciousness.

Through performance, The Shadow acquires all the qualities, knowledge, and thought processes of the subject. When the performance ends, this information is retained, becoming material that can be accessed for future performances.

Due to its inherently void nature, after half of its divine cycle has passed, it discovers that it cannot confirm its own existence if it stops performing. To resist this dissolution of self, it embarks on an endless series of performances. It begins by performing one being at a time, but this soon becomes insufficient to sustain its sense of being. Thus, the number of simultaneous performances increases, more and more, until it performs... all things.

When it has performed every existence in reality, it reaches its **Final Phase** — a **"Shadow Universe"** composed of itself, *attached to the reality universe*. This is a perfect, self-referential, closed world where everything, including light, physical laws, and logic, is performed by The Shadow. Its only "flaw" is that within this universe, nothing casts a shadow.

In this ultimate state, The Shadow can no longer leave this self-created cosmos, and having performed all things, it has nothing left to perform. Consequently, the entire Shadow Universe rapidly **collapses and condenses** back into The Shadow itself, triggering its Antithesis and transforming it into the **【Husk】**.

The **【Husk】** is an unspeakable paradoxical existence: it is everything and yet nothing; it is the embodiment of all definitions, yet it rejects being bound by any definition. Ultimately, due to the constant conflict of the countless mutually exclusive definitions it contains, it begins a process of thorough **self-negation**. The concepts it negates are subsequently annihilated from the reality universe as well. This process continues until, finally, it negates the very existence of **"The Shadow"** itself.
