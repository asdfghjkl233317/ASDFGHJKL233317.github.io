# 记录 / The Record

---

### 中文设定

**记录**是宇宙中唯一凌驾于概念之上的最高神祇。在行使权能时其通常处于**无形体的纯粹意识状态**，与宇宙法则本身融为一体。
其权能分为两种形态：

* **客观记录**：自动地、无条件地记录当前宇宙中发生的一切。
* **主观记录**：由祂主动写下未来必定会发生的事件。所写下之事必将实现，且整个过程会保持因果自洽，无缝融入宇宙的历史。

在自然时间流逝下，记录达到反位的周期远长于其他神祇。频繁使用主观记录权能操作宇宙事物并不会直接影响祂，但祂会持续读取客观记录，监测是否存在即将达到终相、濒临反位的神。一旦发现，便会执行**删除**。删除一个处于终相状态的神，将显著缩短记录自身抵达反位的周期。

记录的终相，是对当前宇宙执行最后一次全面扫描：
* 若宇宙中存在**已反位并持续造成损害的神**，且记录自身已无力通过常规手段将其删除，祂将进入 **【反位·抹除】**。
* 若当前宇宙健康无事，祂则会选择**将自身删除**。

**【反位·抹除】** 是其存在的终极体现：清除当前所有的客观记录与主观记载，继而将宇宙中的一切存在归于空无，等待下一次轮回与重新演化。

### English Setting

**The Record** is the supreme deity of the universe, the only existence transcendent above mere Concepts. When exercising its authority, it typically exists as an **incorporal, pure consciousness**, merging with the cosmic laws themselves.
Its authority manifests in two forms:

* **Objective Recording**: Automatically and unconditionally documents everything that occurs within the current universe.
* **Subjective Recording**: Actively inscribes events that are destined to happen in the future. Anything written *will* occur, with the entire process remaining causally self-consistent and seamlessly integrated into the universe's history.

Under the flow of natural time, The Record's cycle towards Antithesis is far longer than that of any other god. Exercising its Subjective Recording to manipulate cosmic affairs does not directly affect it. However, it continuously reads the Objective Record to monitor for any god approaching their final phase and imminent Antithesis. Upon detection, it executes **Deletion**. Deleting a god in its terminal phase significantly shortens The Record's own cycle towards Antithesis.

The Record's final phase is one last comprehensive scan of the universe:
* If the universe contains **gods who have already undergone Antithesis and are causing ongoing damage**, and The Record itself lacks the power to delete them through routine means, it will initiate **【Antithesis • Erasure】**.
* If the current universe is healthy and without such issues, it will choose to **delete itself**.

**【Antithesis • Erasure】** is the ultimate expression of its existence: it purges all current Objective and Subjective Records, then reduces all existence in the universe to nothingness, awaiting the next cycle of rebirth and re-evolution.
