# 反位 / Antithesis

---

### 中文

**反位**是此方宇宙的底层逻辑与终极法则，所有神祇的故事都围绕着这一核心展开。

其根源在于，每一位神祇都被其神格深处与生俱来的**根本性空虚**所驱动。为了填补这份空虚，祂们不得不将自身所代表的**概念（权能）** 推向逻辑的极致。然而，当这个概念发展到无可再进的顶峰时，便会因自身的内在矛盾或纯粹的完美而过载，最终导致**概念的自我瓦解**，或是产生与初衷完全相反的**反效果**。

因此，反位并非来自外部的毁灭，而是源于神性内部的、必然的**自我否定**。它是悬挂于所有神明头顶的达摩克利斯之剑，是宇宙维持动态平衡的、最残酷的机制。

### English

**Antithesis** is the fundamental law and ultimate principle of this universe. The narratives of all gods revolve around this core.

Its origin lies in the **fundamental void** inherent within the divinity of each god. Driven to fill this void, they are compelled to push the **Concept (their authority)** they represent to its logical extreme. However, when a concept reaches its pinnacle and can advance no further, it becomes overloaded by its own internal contradictions or sheer perfection, ultimately leading to the **concept's self-dismantling** or the emergence of a **reverse effect** completely contrary to its original purpose.

Thus, Antithesis is not destruction from without, but an inevitable **self-negation** born from within the divine itself. It is the Sword of Damocles hanging over all deities, the universe's most cruel mechanism for maintaining dynamic balance.
